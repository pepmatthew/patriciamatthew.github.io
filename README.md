As CEO of KW Realty Las Vegas and a seasoned fractional consultant, I specialize in helping real estate professionals launch, grow, and scale their businesses to achieve sustainable success.

My comprehensive background spans real estate sales, construction, new home development, and mortgage asset management, giving me unique insights into every aspect of the industry.

I believe in creating businesses that don't just generate wealth, but allow you the time and freedom to enjoy the love, health, and prosperity you've worked so hard to build.
